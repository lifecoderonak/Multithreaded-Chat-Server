A client, say client 0, should be able to send following types of messages (one marks each):
a) Client X: Message - the message will be delivered to Client X.
b) All: Message - the message will be delivered to all present clients.
c) Client X,Y: Message - the message will be delivered to Client X and Y only
d) Server: "List All" - the message will go to server which will then reply with the list of all the clients that are currently connected.
e) If a client sends a message to another client which does not exist then the server should reply back saying the client does not exist.
